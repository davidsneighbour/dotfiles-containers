* setup app
* setup gmail variables in .env (NOT docker-compose.env)
* add email account (remove old ones)
* edit mail rules to add the new email account

the app is not public, so there will be a couple of warnings about the app potentially not being safe, which is ok.

docker containers need to restart after .env is changed.

"Google Advanced Security" will lead to the APP not being verified and disabled.
